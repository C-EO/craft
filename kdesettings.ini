[General]

## Here you set the compiler to be used.
## mingw4   - use the mingw gcc compiler (recommended)
## msvc2010 - use the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 compiler
## msvc2012 - use the Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 compiler
## msvc2013 - use the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 compiler
KDECOMPILER = mingw4
##  possible values x86 or x64
EMERGE_ARCHITECTURE = x86

## This option can be used to override the default make program
## change the value to the path of the executable you want to use instead.
EMERGE_MAKE_PROGRAM = jom

## This option can be used to enable a notification backend.
## As soon as the buildprocess of a project has finished a notification will be displayed.
## Possible Backends:
## Snarl      http://snarl.fullphat.net/
## Toaster    Toaster will display a Windows 8 toast notification
## Snore      https://github.com/Snorenotify/Snorenotify. Snore supports multiple backends. You need to install snore-send using emerge.
#EMERGE_USE_NOTIFY = Snarl;Toaster

## Speed up the merging of packages by using hard links
UseHardlinks = True

## Whether to use ccache (only avalible with mingw compiler)
#EMERGE_USE_CCACHE = True

## the buildtype of this installation, default is RelWithDebInfo
## Possible Values:
## Release
## RelWithDebInfo
## Debug
## MinSizeRel
#EMERGE_BUILDTYPE = Debug


## Enable this option if you want to have shorter build times, and less
## disk usage. It will then avoid copying source code files of the KDE
## svn repository. To disable, EMERGE_NOCOPY = False.
EMERGE_NOCOPY = True

## Override the default target if this version is available.
#EMERGE_TARGET = 4.9.3

[Paths]
## This is the location of your python installation.
## This value must be set.
PYTHONPATH = C:\python34

## Here you change the download directory.
## If you want, so you can share the same download directory between
## mingw and msvc.
## The default value is emerge/../download
#DOWNLOADDIR = C:\kde\download

## This option defines the location for git checkouts.
## The default value is emerge/../download/git
#KDEGITDIR = ${DOWNLOADDIR}\git

## This option defines the location for svn checkouts.
## The default value is emerge/../download/svn
#KDESVNDIR = ${DOWNLOADDIR}\svn

## This option defines the location where the ccache files are stored.
## The default location is KDEROOT/build/ccache
#CCACHE_DIR = C:\CCACHE\kf5




[ShortPath]
## substitute pathes by drives
## This option is needed to avoid path limit problems in case of long base pathes
## and compiling big packages like qt
## If you disable it do _not_ use any paths longer than 6 letters in the
## directory settings
EMERGE_USE_SHORT_PATH = True

## each drive could be commented out to skip substution

[Portage]
## This adds the possibility to disable cretin packages
## For portage recipes configure options can be added by 
## "if self.subinfo.options.isActive("binary/mysql-pkg"):"
## PACKAGE_IGNORES = dev-util/git;dev-util/msys;kdesupport/kdewin

[PortageVersions]
## Tries to override the default target for all packages
#DefaultTarget = 5.0

## Overide the default version for a package.
## For a normal package add category/package, like win32libs/libpng and set the Version
## For meta packages like Qt5 you can directly set the version for the whole package
#Qt5 = 5.2.1
#KDE = 4.89.0
#Boost = 1_55_0
#win32libs/libpng = 1.2.43

[EmergeDebug]
## If you want to have verbose output, uncomment the following option
## and set it to positive integer for verbose output and to 0
## or disable it for normal output. Currently the highest verbosity level
## is 3 (equal to 'emerge -v -v -v'). level 0 equals 'emerge -q'
Verbose = 1

## Prints time spend on various emerge tasks

## Dump internal state of emergeSettings to kdesettings.ini.dump
