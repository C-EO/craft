## or disable it for normal output. Currently the highest verbosity level
## is 3 (equal to 'emerge -v -v -v'). level 0 equals 'emerge -q'
EMERGE_VERBOSE=1


## Enable this option if you want to have shorter build times, and less
## disk usage. It will then avoid copying source code files of the KDE
## svn repository. To disable, EMERGE_NOCOPY=False.
EMERGE_NOCOPY=True


#EMERGE_TARGET=4.9.3

[Paths]
KDEROOT=D:\kde
PYTHONPATH=C:\python32
## Here you change the download directory.
## If you want, so you can share the same download directory between
## mingw and msvc.
DOWNLOADDIR=${KDEROOT}\download
## This option defines the location for git checkouts.
KDEGITDIR=${DOWNLOADDIR}\git
## This option defines the location for svn checkouts.
KDESVNDIR=${DOWNLOADDIR}\svn



[ShortPath]
## substitute pathes by drives
## This option is needed to avoid path limit problems in case of long base pathes
## and compiling big packages like qt
## If you disable it do _not_ use any paths longer than 6 letters in the
## directory settings
EMERGE_USE_SHORT_PATH=True

## each drive could be commented out to skip substution
